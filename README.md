# ScrapeOutlookEmail
The email contains information on traffics which is sent by senders automatically when any irregularities are reported.
I scraped the following information as requirements to MongoDB : date & time of email received, additional delay time, traffic rate, speed (km/h) and distance (km). This email also includes a screenshot of map area showing the congested area which then I saved locally (ScrapeImg.py).

This is a work in progress. In later stage, I will store the data in Azure Blob Storage for all information I scraped including the image. Stay tuned!
